	abstract = {The aim of this graduate-level textbook is to present and explain, at other than a superficial level, modem ab initio approaches to the calculation of the electronic structure and properties of molecules. The first three chapters contain introductory material culminating in a thorough discussion of the Hartree-Fock approximation.The remaining four chapters describe a variety of more sophisticated approaches, which improve upon this approximation.Among the highlights of the seven chapters are (1) a review of the mathematics (mostly matrix algebra) required for the rest of the book, (2) an introduction to the basic techniques, ideas, and notations of quantum chemistry, (3) a thorough discussion of the Hartree-Fock approximation, (4) a treatment of configuration interaction (Cl) and approaches incorporating electron correlation, (5) a description of the independent electron pair approximation and a variety of more sophisticated approaches that incorporate coupling between pairs, (6) a consideration of the perturbative approach to the calculation of the correlation energy of many-electron systems and (7) a brief introduction to the use of the one-particle many-body Green's function in quantum chemistry.Over 150 exercises, designed to help the reader acquire a working knowledge of the material, are embedded in the text. The book is largely self-contained and requires no prerequisite other than a solid undergraduate physical chemistry course; however, some exposure to quantum chemistry will enhance the student's appreciation of the material. Clear and well-written, this text is ideal for the second semester of a two-semester course in quantum chemistry, or for a special topics course.},

	abstract = {The second order contribution to π correlation energy of linear polyenes and polyacenes is studied in two partitions of the C.I. matrix, starting from delocalized Molecular Orbitals. When one uses the classical partition H=HSCF+V, the correlation energy increases proportionnai to the number of electrons, quite independently of the shape of the molecule. Another partition, which insures the perturbation matrix to be zero-diagonal, gives a larger 2 nd order correlation energy; the difference between the 2 nd order contributions of these two expressions tends to a constant and is larger for a compact system than for a linear one. The dependence of the correlation energy to the values of bielectronic integrals used at short distances shows that it arises mainly from short range interactions.Some statistical models of C.I. matrices are proposed on the basis of the results obtained here. They give some interesting results for second order energies but do not seem to be satisfactory for higher orders.},

The results are strictly equivalent to the canonical formulation if no further approximations are introduced. The new formalism permits the extension of the local correlation method to Møller-Plesset theory. It also facilitates the treatment of weak pairs at a lower (e.g., second order) level of theory in CI and coupled cluster methods. Based on our formalism, an MP2 gradient algorithm is outlined which does not require the storage of derivative integrals, integrals with three external MO indices, and, using the method of Handy and Schaefer, the repeated solution of the coupled-perturbed SCF equations.},

Gallier offers an introduction to affine geometry, projective geometry, Euclidean geometry, basics of differential geometry and Lie groups, and a glimpse of computational geometry (convex sets, Voronoi diagrams and Delaunay triangulations) and explores many of the practical applications of geometry. Some of these applications include computer vision (camera calibration) efficient communication, error correcting codes, cryptography, motion interpolation, and robot kinematics.

	abstract = {A unitary coupled cluster (UCC) form for the wave function in the variational quantum eigensolver has been suggested as a systematic way to go beyond the mean-field approximation and include electron correlation in solving quantum chemistry problems on a quantum computer. Although being exact in the limit of including all possible coupled cluster excitations, practically, the accuracy of this approach depends on the number and type of terms are included in the wave function parametrization. Another difficulty of UCC is a growth of the number of simultaneously entangled qubits even at the fixed Fermionic excitation rank. Not all quantum computing architectures can cope with this growth. To address both problems, we introduce a qubit coupled cluster (QCC) method that starts directly in the qubit space and uses energy response estimates for ranking the importance of individual entanglers for the variational energy minimization. Also, we provide an exact factorization of a unitary rotation of more than two qubits to a product of two-qubit unitary rotations. Thus, the QCC method with the factorization technique can be limited to only two-qubit entanglement gates and allows for very efficient use of quantum resources in terms of the number of coupled cluster operators. The method performance is illustrated by calculating ground-state potential energy curves of H2 and LiH molecules with chemical accuracy, ≤1 kcal/mol, and a symmetric water dissociation curve.},

	abstract = {We introduce a unitary coupled-cluster (UCC) ansatz termed \$k\$-UpCCGSD that is based on a family of sparse generalized doubles (D) operators which provides an affordable and systematically improvable unitary coupled-cluster wavefunction suitable for implementation on a near-term quantum computer. \$k\$-UpCCGSD employs \$k\$ products of the exponential of pair coupled-cluster double excitation operators (pCCD), together with generalized single (S) excitation operators. We compare its performance in both efficiency of implementation and accuracy with that of the generalized UCC ansatz employing the full generalized SD excitation operators (UCCGSD), as well as with the standard ansatz employing only SD excitations (UCCSD). \$k\$-UpCCGSD is found to show the best scaling for quantum computing applications, requiring a circuit depth of \${\textbackslash}mathcal O(kN)\$, compared with \${\textbackslash}mathcal O(N{\textasciicircum}3)\$ for UCCGSD and \${\textbackslash}mathcal O((N-{\textbackslash}eta){\textasciicircum}2 {\textbackslash}eta)\$ for UCCSD where \$N\$ is the number of spin orbitals and \${\textbackslash}eta\$ is the number of electrons. We analyzed the accuracy of these three ans{\textbackslash}"atze by making classical benchmark calculations on the ground state and the first excited state of H\$\_4\$ (STO-3G, 6-31G), H\$\_2\$O (STO-3G), and N\$\_2\$ (STO-3G), making additional comparisons to conventional coupled cluster methods. The results for ground states show that \$k\$-UpCCGSD offers a good tradeoff between accuracy and cost, achieving chemical accuracy for lower cost of implementation on quantum computers than both UCCGSD and UCCSD. Excited states are calculated with an orthogonally constrained variational quantum eigensolver approach. This is seen to generally yield less accurate energies than for the corresponding ground states. We demonstrate that using a specialized multi-determinantal reference state constructed from classical linear response calculations allows these excited state energetics to be improved.},
