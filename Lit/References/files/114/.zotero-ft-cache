A unitary coupled cluster (UCC) form for the wave function in the variational quantum eigensolver has been suggested as a systematic way to go beyond the mean-field approximation and include electron correlation in solving quantum chemistry problems on a quantum computer. Although being exact in the limit of including all possible coupled cluster excitations, practically, the accuracy of this approach depends on the number and type of terms are included in the wave function parametrization. Another difficulty of UCC is a growth of the number of simultaneously entangled qubits even at the fixed Fermionic excitation rank. Not all quantum computing architectures can cope with this growth. To address both problems, we introduce a qubit coupled cluster (QCC) method that starts directly in the qubit space and uses energy response estimates for ranking the importance of individual entanglers for the variational energy minimization. Also, we provide an exact factorization of a unitary rotation of more than two qubits to a product of two-qubit unitary rotations. Thus, the QCC method with the factorization technique can be limited to only two-qubit entanglement gates and allows for very efficient use of quantum resources in terms of the number of coupled cluster operators. The method performance is illustrated by calculating ground-state potential energy curves of H 2 and LiH molecules with chemical accuracy, ≤1 kcal/mol, and a symmetric water dissociation curve.

A many-body Fermionic problem defining electronic properties of molecules and materials from first-principles can be written as the following parametric time-independent Schrödinger equation (1) Here, R = ( R 1 , ..., R N n ) are nuclear variables treated as parameters, E i ( R ) and |Ψ i ( R )⟩ are potential energy surfaces (PESs) and adiabatic electronic states, respectively, and Ĥ e ( R ) is the electronic Hamiltonian of the system (2) where r i are the electronic variables and N e and N n are the number of electrons and nuclei. Computational cost of the exact numerical solution of eq 1 scales exponentially with the size (e.g., the number of electrons) of the system on a classical computer. To address this issue without introducing approximations, it was proposed to employ a quantum computer, (1,2) which may solve the problem with polynomial scaling of computational cost with the system size.
However, immediate application of quantum computers is hampered by the limited quantity and quality of available quantum resources. In particular, contemporary architectures offer only a few (<10) fully interacting qubits, and their quantum coherent state can exist for limited time. As can be gauged both from theoretical and experimental efforts, scaling-up the quantum computer is far from straightforward. Even anticipating noticeable growth of capabilities of quantum hardware in the near future, to become competitive with solving the electronic structure problem on classical computers, it is crucial to develop computationally frugal algorithms utilizing present and near future quantum computers in full.
Several algorithmic developments in this direction have already taken place. In order to formulate the electronic structure problem for a quantum computer that operates with qubits (two-level systems), the electronic Hamiltonian needs to be transformed isospectrally to a qubit form. This is done in two steps. First, the second quantized form of Ĥ e is obtained (3) where â p † ( â p ) are Fermionic creation (annihilation) operators, h pq ( R ) and g pqrs ( R ) are one- and two-electron integrals in a spin–orbital basis. (3) This step has polynomial complexity and is carried out on a classical computer. Then, using the Jordan–Wigner (JW) (2,4) or more resource-efficient Bravyi–Kitaev (BK) transformation, (5−9) the electronic Hamiltonian is converted isospectrally to a qubit form (4) where C I ( R ) are numerical coefficients and P̂ I are Pauli “words”, products of Pauli operators of different qubits (5) ŵ i ( I ) is one of the x̂ , ŷ , ẑ Pauli operators for the i th qubit.
The quantum phase estimation (QPE) algorithm (2,10,11) was historically the first approach that relied on estimating the phase of the stationary-state wave function using the quantum Fourier transform. (12) For good accuracy one would need to perform a long coherent evolution of the system for accurate phase estimation. Practical difficulties in maintaining qubits’ coherence for long time hinder the use of the QPE approach for quantum chemistry simulations on currently available quantum computers.
This prompted a development of a more resource-efficient method, the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE), (13,14) where the trial ground-state stationary wave function, Ψ, is prepared by an action of a suitably chosen unitary operator Û on an initial state of qubits |Φ⟩, |Ψ⟩ = Û |Φ⟩. Û is optimized variationally to provide an estimate for the ground-state exact energy (6) Of course, there is a great deal of freedom in parametrization of Û . The original proposal of ref (13) was to borrow the parametrization of Û from the Fermion-to-qubit transformation of a Fermionic unitary coupled cluster (UCC) ansatz, (7) where Here T̂ k are mutually commuting Fermionic k -fold (e.g. single, double, etc.) excitation operators that promote electrons from occupied orbitals i , j , ... to unoccupied (virtual) orbitals a , b , ... in a reference single-determinant |Φ⟩ and parametrized by the corresponding amplitudes t i a , t ij ab , .... T̂ may be truncated at rank m ≤ N e , leading to an approximate treatment, but at any rank greater than 1 the UCC ansatz is exponentially hard for a classical computer due to nontruncation of the Baker–Campbell–Hausdorff series. (15) On the other hand, it is known that coupled cluster-type expansions are quickly convergent, especially if electron correlation is not too strong; (16) thus, there is a hope to find accurate energy estimates already at the low rank.
Yet, even though superiority of the UCC-based VQE approach over QPE has been convincingly demonstrated, (17) the computational cost of UCC still grows relatively quickly even at low orders. The main difficulty is that all Fermion-to-qubit transformations increase the length of Pauli words involved in Û . In other words, even if only a one-body cluster operator, T̂ 1 , is used for Û CC , its qubit representation is a unitary operator involving Pauli words of the length ∼ log( N o ) (in the case of the BK transformation, others increase the length even faster), where N o is the number of one-electron spin–orbitals in the second quantized form of Ĥ e . For some lattice models there are special transformations that limit this growth of locality , (9) but for a general molecular Hamiltonian the best count is still logarithmic. This becomes a challenge because multiqubit operations require either entangling of increasing number of qubits (not all quantum computers can do that) or factorizing the multiqubit operation as a product of one- and two-qubit ones. The latter was shown to be possible in principle, but there are no general approaches to construct an efficient factorization proposed to date. (12) A typical approximate approach involves Trotterization. (18) Frequently, Fermionic excitation operators, eqs 9 and 10 , are transformed to a qubit form and Trotterized. (19,20)
Another strategy for constructing the wave function has been adopted recently in ref (21) . The wave function ansatz was tailored to hardware requirements and had the form (11) where N q is the number of qubits, |00···0⟩ is an initial state of the qubits and is the exact equivalent of |Φ⟩ in eq 6 . Equation 11 is an alternating sequence of products of individual qubit rotations U q , j ( θ ), (12) where θ 1 q,j , θ 2 q,j , and θ 3 q,j are the Euler angles of the q th qubit at the j th level, interleaved with action of “entanglers” (13) where τ is an amplitude and P̂ is a two-qubit Pauli word. The number d was called a depth of the scheme. The first set of z -rotations in U q ,0 ( θ ) was not implemented (θ 3 q ,0 = 0, q = 1... N q ), and entanglers’ amplitudes τ were all kept fixed, so that the ansatz ( 11 ) contained N q (3 d + 2) variational parameters in total. By minimizing the expectation value of the Hamiltonian, eq 6 , with respect to these parameters for sufficiently high depths, reasonably accurate ground-state electronic energies as functions of internuclear distances for molecules H 2 , LiH, and BeH 2 were obtained.
The obvious advantage of the form ( 11 ) is its minimal degree of entanglement, only two qubits at a time. The unitary transformation is given directly in the qubit space, in contrast to the UCC form that starts with Fermionic operators. Perhaps, this fact alone is responsible for considerable reduction of quantum resources needed for simulations and eventually allowed for successful simulations of molecules larger than H 2 . The rigorous basis for convergence of ansatz ( 11 ) to the exact answer with increasing depth d is the theorem stating that any multiqubit unitary transformation can be presented as a product of one- and two-qubit unitary transformations. (22) However, efficient construction of such a factorization is a yet unsolved problem. Therefore, it is clear that the form ( 11 ) can be improved if some specifics of the problem are taken into account. First, it can be shown that only two individual qubit rotation angles per each qubit are sufficient at any d , provided that entanglers’ amplitudes are fully optimized. Second, a set of predefined generators of entanglement P̂ ( eq 13 ) may not lead to the fastest convergence—it is the system which defines the most “efficient” entanglers, not the hardware.
In the current work we introduce a new systematic approach, a qubit coupled cluster (QCC) method, within the VQE formalism. QCC resembles a coupled cluster hierarchy, but contrary to UCC, it is built directly in the qubit space. Therefore, we bypass any explicit Fermionic constructions and save as much quantum resources as possible. To achieve systematic convergence, we introduce an entanglers’ screening protocol that ranks various entanglers according to their estimated contributions into the correlation energy. To allow for arbitrary multiqubit entanglers on limited-qubit hardware, we derive an exact factorization formula that represents a multiqubit entangler as a product of two-qubit entanglers. This factorization uses commutation relations of the qubit Lie algebra and introduces the minimal number of terms. We illustrate its essential features on ground potential energy curves of the H 2 and LiH molecules, and a symmetric O-H stretch of the water molecule. These molecules are small enough to be amenable for a comprehensive study, while at the same time are complex enough to illustrate many quantum-chemical phenomena, including the transition to the strong-correlation limit upon dissociation.

2.1. Qubit Coupled Cluster Method
The QCC wave function has the form (14) where | Ω ⟩ and Û ( τ ) represent the mean-field and correlation parts of a wave function. The mean-field wave function is a product of single-qubit coherent states (23−26) where ϕ i and θ i are azimuthal and polar angles on the “Bloch sphere” of the i th qubit, respectively, and |α⟩ and |β⟩ are spin-up and spin-down eigenstates of the ŝ z ( i ) = ẑ i /2 operator. The single-qubit coherent states constitute a normalized but nonorthogonal complete set. Correlation is introduced by multiqubit rotations parametrized by real-valued amplitudes τ = {τ k } as (17) where P̂ k are the Pauli words ( eq 5 ) whose lengths vary from 2 to N q , N ent is less or equal to the total number of possible P̂ k operators, 4 N q – 3 N q – 1, and a factor of 1/2 is introduced for convenience.
The expectation value of the Hamiltonian for the QCC parametrization ( eq 14 ) is and minimization of E ( τ , Ω ) with respect to amplitudes τ and angles in Ω provides the ground-state energy. The main difference between QCC and UCC forms is in the nature of generators of unitary transformations. In the UCC formalism generators are sums of mutually commuting Fermionic operators ( eqs 8–10 ); each of those, in turn, after the JW or BK transformation is a lengthy linear combination of Pauli words. This leads to excessive consumption of precious quantum resources, for example, two-particle entangling gates. Moreover, exponents of such quantities are not known in closed form and are not amenable for extensive analysis. In contrast, the P̂ k generators of the QCC ansatz are simple Pauli words, and thus, all of them are involutory operators, P̂ k 2 = 1. This property provides a closed form for similarity-transformed Hamiltonians of individual entanglers (20) Hence, it is obvious that the fully transformed Hamiltonian H̃ = U ( τ ) † ĤU ( τ ) in eq 19 will involve ∼3 N ent operators thus revealing the exponential complexity of the QCC form.
Overall, the QCC scheme requires 2 N q + N ent variational parameters, where 2 N q is the number of Bloch angles for N q qubits, and N ent is the number of optimized entanglers’ amplitudes.
One possible concern about using Pauli words as generators is potential breaking of physical symmetries by a trial electronic function and ensuing unphysical behavior of energy and properties. Indeed, an approximated wave function is prone to such a phenomenon, (27) and as we found in ref (28) , it is more a rule than an exception. However, the QCC formalism can be equipped with constraints, such as the particle number or electronic spin, in a straightforward manner to guarantee conservation of proper physical symmetries.
2.2. Entanglers’ Ranking
The key quantity in our ranking of all 4 N q – 3 N q – 1 entanglers for the N q -qubit system is the similarity-transformed energy function, (21) Using the closed form of the similarity-transformed Hamiltonian, eq 20 , it is straightforward to evaluate E [τ; P̂ k ] and to find the energy lowering due to variation of τ (22) Here E QMF = min Ω ⟨ Ω | Ĥ | Ω ⟩ is the qubit mean-field (QMF) energy, which is equivalent to E [0; P̂ k ]. Thus, all entanglers can be ranked according to their Δ E [ P̂ k ] values. The main downside of this procedure is its computational cost: it requires full optimization of both τ and the mean-field angles Ω for each entangler that can be expensive for large systems.
To alleviate this problem, a prescreening based on the first and second terms of the Taylor expansion of individual similarity-transformed energies ( eq 21 ) (23) can be done. One caveat in calculating these derivatives is accounting for the relaxation of the mean-field part due to changes in τ. Essentially, for every value of τ the minimizing set of Bloch angles is different; therefore they are implicit functions τ. Thus, the full τ derivative in eq 23 can be expanded as (24) where {φ i } i =1 2 N q denotes {θ 1 , ϕ 1 , ..., θ N q , ϕ N q }, the set of the Bloch angles parametrizing the mean-field solution. It is straightforward to show (see the Appendix ) that the first derivative at τ = 0 is given by (25) where | Ω min ⟩ is a coherent state evaluated on the set of optimized at the mean-field level angles {φ i }. Evaluation of the second-order derivative in eq 23 is more involved and is detailed in the Appendix .
Thus, the important entanglers can be ranked within two tiers. The first tier is formed by the entanglers with nonzero absolute values of their first energy derivatives ( eq 25 ). The second tier includes the entanglers with vanishing first energy derivatives but significant negative second energy derivatives, eq 45 . The final ranking is done based on evaluating Δ E [ P̂ k ] values for top entanglers in both tiers.
2.3. Factorization of Multiqubit Entanglers
Existing quantum hardware is typically limited in the form of operators it can efficiently implement. One of such limitations is the maximum number of qubits that are possible to entangle by realizable unitary transformations; in other words, the length of the Pauli word [ eq 5 ] generating a unitary transformation is usually limited to two qubits. Thus, if our ranking procedure identifies three- or four-body entanglers as contributing significantly to the energy lowering, it may not be possible to directly implement them due to hardware limitations.
Here, we show how to factorize a unitary transformation entangling more than two qubits in a product of unitary transformations involving only two-qubit generators. The factorization is a recursive procedure applied at each step to a many-qubit unitary to produce three new unitaries, each of them parametrized by fewer-qubits Pauli words.
The elementary factorization step can be illustrated as follows:
(1) Assume we have Pauli word P̂ of the length | P̂ | ≥ 3, where the length | · | is defined as the number of Pauli operators in P̂ . Then P̂ can be represented as (26) where the subscript of ŵ k denotes that this elementary Pauli operator corresponds to the k th qubit. The word P̂ 1 ( P̂ 2 ) contains all qubit indices that are strictly greater (lower) than k . P̂ 1 , P̂ 2 , and ŵ k are all mutually commutative, since they act on nonoverlapping sets of qubits. Also by a choice of k one can always satisfy the following relations (27)
(2) Let us denote ŵ k ′ and ŵ k ″ the Pauli operators for the k th qubit that satisfy the following commutation relation with ŵ k (28) which is always possible by properties of single-qubit Pauli operators. Substituting ŵ k by its commutator in eq 26 gives (29) On the other hand, the same commutator as in eq 29 can be obtained if the expression exp[ i (π/4) ŵ k ″ P̂ 2 ] P̂ 1 ŵ k ′ exp[− i (π/4) ŵ k ″ P̂ 2 ] is considered using eq 20 , and therefore (30)
(3) Finally, from eq 30 it follows that (31) and therefore, exponentiation of P̂ using the Taylor series gives the final factorization (32) Equation 32 expresses the unitary transformation with the generator P̂ as a product of three unitary transformations with generators of at most length. Thus, the number of two-qubit factors grows as ∼3 log 2  | P̂ | = | P | log 2  3 ≈ | P | 1.585 . Also, note that the factorization does not increase the number of variational parameters, only the number of entanglers.

We illustrate our developments by computing the ground-state potential energy curves for the H 2 and LiH molecules and a symmetric O–H stretching curve for the H 2 O molecule within the QMF and QCC approaches. H 2 and LiH were used previously (21,29) to illustrate performance of quantum computing techniques, while the H 2 O example is particularly interesting because it is a strong-correlation problem with more than one correlated pair of electrons, for which the traditional coupled cluster singles and doubles (CCSD) approach is known to fail giving energy below the exact value at large O–H distances. (30)
3.1. Fermionic Hamiltonian Quantities
To generate spin–orbitals and one- and two-electron integrals, a locally modified gamess (31) electronic structure package was used.
The diatomic molecules H 2 and LiH were oriented along the z axis, while H 2 O was in the xz plane. D 2 h and C 2 v symmetry groups were used for H 2 and LiH/H 2 O, respectively. [The full molecular symmetry group for diatomics is D ∞ h and C ∞ v , but the maximal Abelian subgroups with all-real irreducible representations were chosen instead for the sake of implementation simplicity.] Canonical restricted Hartree–Fock (RHF) orbitals were computed in the STO-3G atomic basis set (32) for H 2 and LiH, while for H 2 O we used the 6-31G basis set. (32)
For the H 2 molecule all four spin–orbitals that arise from two molecular Hartree–Fock ones were taken into account in construction of the second-quantized electronic Hamiltonian, eq 3 .
For the LiH molecule we determine a subset of “active” spin–orbitals to produce the electronic Hamiltonian as follows. Out of six molecular orbitals of LiH, four belong to a 1 and the two remaining correspond to the b 1 and b 2 irreducible representations of the C 2 v group. The lowest-energy a 1 -type orbital and both b -type orbitals were frozen, which means their populations were fixed at 2, 0, and 0, respectively. The remaining three orbitals of a 1 -type constituted a complete active space (CAS) where the electronic Hamiltonian ( 3 ) was computed. It must be noted that one of a 1 orbitals lies higher in energy than both b -type ones, so that reordering of the canonical RHF orbitals, which are typically sorted by orbital energy, was necessary.
A similar procedure has been applied to electronic structure calculations for the H 2 O molecule. As in ref (32) , we fixed ∠HOH = 107.6° and calculated canonical RHF molecular orbitals for R (O–H) from 0.75 to 2.75 Å. Two lowest-energy orbitals were kept doubly occupied, while the next five were arranged in order 5–3–4–6–7; the last four (2 a 1 and 2 b 1 in C 2 v symmetry) were taken as active, forming a complete active space with four electrons—CAS(4,4).
All molecular integral transformations were carried out by the aldet module; this module was also used to generate reference complete active space configurational interaction (CASCI) energies.
3.2. Generation of Qubit Operators
H 2 Molecule
One- and two-electron integrals in the canonical RHF molecular orbitals basis for each value of the internuclear distance, R (H–H), were used in the BK transformation to produce the corresponding qubit Hamiltonians. Spin–orbitals were alternating in the order α, β, α, .... Although qubits 2 and 4 are known to be stationary, in other words, all operators in the qubit Hamiltonian act by only z or the identity operators on these qubits, we did not use this additional symmetry to decrease the qubit count in the qubit Hamiltonians, so that all four qubits corresponding to four spin–orbitals were retained. The number of electrons, N̂ , and the square of the total spin, Ŝ 2 , operators were prepared from their second-quantized Fermionic expressions. (3) These operators are extremely useful in analysis of both QMF and QCC solutions.
LiH Molecule
Qubit Hamiltonians for various R (Li–H) distances were generated using the parity Fermion-to-qubit transformation. (33) Spin–orbitals were arranged as “first all α then all β” in the Fermionic form; since there are three active molecular orbitals in the problem, this lead to a six-qubit Hamiltonian containing 118 Pauli words for each R (Li–H) . These qubit Hamiltonians have third and sixth stationary qubits, which allows one to replace the corresponding ẑ operators by their eigenvalues, ±1, thus defining the different “sectors” of the original Hamiltonian. Each of these sectors is characterized by its own four-qubit effective Hamiltonian. The ground state lies in the z 2 = −1, z 5 = 1 (qubits are enumerated from 0) sector; the corresponding effective Hamiltonian has 100 Pauli terms. Analogous reduction procedure has been applied to the qubit images of N̂ and Ŝ 2 operators.
H 2 O Molecule
CAS(4, 4) electronic Hamiltonians at different O–H distances were converted to the qubit form using the BK transformation grouping spin–orbitals as “first all alpha than all beta”. The resulting eight-qubit Hamitonians contained 185 Pauli terms. Fourth and eighth qubits were found to be stationary; the ground-state solution is located in the z 3 = 1, z 7 = 1 subspace. By integrating out z 3 and z 7 , a six-qubit reduced Hamiltonian with 165 terms was derived. It is used to report all QCC results for the H 2 O molecule. Eight-qubit BK images of the N̂ and Ŝ 2 operators have been also reduced by assigning z 3 = 1 and z 7 = 1.
3.3. Potential Energy Curves
As we established in ref (28) , variational methods in qubit space are prone to symmetry breaking. This is particularly dramatically seen in the QMF case ( Figures 1 and 3 ). To restore the correct singlet spin symmetry and to make PESs smooth, it is enough to impose the spin constraint (⟨ S 2 ⟩ = 0) on the QMF solutions. Alternatively, more correlation can be added to QMF to approach the exact solution, which has the correct singlet symmetry. In all our QCC calculations we started with symmetry unconstraint QMF solutions.

Entanglers for H 2
We rank entanglers at R (H–H) = 1.0 Å according to the procedure described in section 2.2 (the full table can be found in the Supporting Information ). Since only two out of four qubits contribute nontrivially to the eigenstates of the H 2 qubit Hamiltonian, two-qubit entanglers are sufficient for obtaining the exact solution. Out of a total of 54 two-qubit entanglers only six provide energy lowering; all of them were found by the combined first- ( eq 25 ) and second-order ( eq 45 ) screening; see Table 1 . Only two of them have a nonzero energy gradient and, thus, are identified by the cheapest first-order test, eq 25 . Moreover, since all six energy-lowering entanglers are related by a simple global frame rotation (change of quantization axis), it is possible to use any one of them for the whole range of R (H–H); see Figure 1 . Thus, the H 2 molecule in the minimal basis requires only one entangler to reach the exact energy. This entangler is readily identified by our ranking procedure without any ad hoc assumptions about the structure of a wave function or reference to Fermionic operators. A quantum computer circuit suitable for the Rigetti machine (34) that solves the H 2 problem by the QCC method with the chosen entangler is shown in Figure 2 . Besides a set of one-qubit gates, such as rotations around x ( RX ) and z ( RZ ) axes, and the Hadamard ( H ) gate, it contains only two two-qubit CNOT gates. They appear as a result of a decomposition (made by PyQuil (35) ) of the unitary transformation generated by the entangler x̂ 2 ŷ 0 into elementary operations possible on the Rigetti machine. The two leftmost rows of single-qubit gates encode the spin coherent states and depend on the Bloch angles (ϕ i , θ i ), i = 1, ..., 4; the RZ gate interlaid between the two CNOT gates depends on the entangler’s amplitude τ.

Two CNOT gates used by the QCC ansatz should be contrasted with 64 two-qubit C X gates that are needed to implement the UCC form in CAS(2,2). [A circuit diagram from which the gate counts are read was generated with the ProjectQ framework. (36,37) ] These numbers clearly show that the QCC method is far superior in the number of two-qubit gates.
Entanglers for LiH
Due to a larger number of entangled spin–orbitals in LiH, the list of entanglers is more complex. Near the equilibrium bond length, R (Li–H) ≈ 1.5 Å, our procedure readily identifies a few (six to seven) entanglers that give chemical accuracy. However, these entanglers do not provide chemical accuracy for the whole curve, R (Li–H) from 0.5 to 5.0 Å. The region where QMF experiences symmetry breaking, R (Li–H) ≳ 3.2 Å, is especially demanding: the list of energetically important entanglers grows substantially, and calculating the same entanglers’ characteristics as before does not shrink it considerably. To achieve reduction, we noticed that since the QMF reference has broken symmetry while the exact eigenstate has the singlet symmetry, it is prudent to search for entanglers that can not only lower the energy but also restore the spin symmetry. To assess the capability of entanglers for symmetry restoration, we calculate the gradient of individual energies on a spin-singlet constraint QMF solution, | Ω c,min ⟩: (33) These gradients are larger for those entanglers that can affect the symmetry of the constrained QMF solution. Using seven of such entanglers, which also have high individual energy lowerings ( Table 2 ), we were able to reach the chemical accuracy for the whole LiH potential energy curve ( Figure 3 ) . Interestingly, these entanglers that can not only restore symmetry but also break it work well for nuclear geometries where symmetry restoration is not needed. We attribute this to the ability of the variational procedure to find amplitudes for the symmetry affecting entanglers so that they do not break QMF symmetry where it is unnecessary.

Δ E [ P ] are evaluated with respect to the symmetry constrained QMF energies.
Applying our factorization procedure to split three- and four-qubit entanglers in Table 2 gives 31 two-qubit entanglers, but some of them may be canceled in the final product. As a result, only 38 two-qubit gates are necessary for implementing the QCC ansatz on a quantum computer. The factorization does not change the number of variational parameters and their total number in the QCC procedure was 2 × 4 + 7 = 15.
If we compare our QCC ansatz with alternatives from the literature for LiH, we find the following. The QPE method with the first-order Trotterization will use ∼100 (the number of terms in the qubit Hamiltonian) exponential factors. Each factor gives rise to two or more two-qubit entanglement gates in the circuit decomposition and hence, several hundreds of two-qubit gates are needed.
Comparison with UCC is more involved. Since UCC works with Fermionic operators, one cannot exploit qubit symmetries. Thus, Fermionic excitations are generated for the original CAS(2e,3o). Limiting consideration by single and double excitations (UCCSD), we found 272 two-qubit gates in the quantum circuit. More fair comparison would be if a procedure to exploit qubit symmetries could be implemented for UCC, but we are not aware of such implementation.
Finally, the form of Kandala et al. (21) seems to be the most economical one: chemical accuracy was achieved with d = 6, which implies at least six pairwise entanglers. However, Kandala et al. (21) use significantly more variational parameters: for four qubits and d = 6 the count is 80. The excessive parametrization makes energy minimization considerably more difficult since the expectation values provided by a quantum computer have inherent quantum uncertainty.
Entanglers for H 2 O
We systematically screened all 4077 two- to six-qubit entanglers at R (O–H) = 1.25 Å; see the Supporting Information for details. Even the first-order selection protocol, eq 25 , identified significantly more entanglers than can be included in QCC simulations in the current implementation. To assess the capabilities of the QCC method notwithstanding, we manually selected one four-qubit entangler that had (among others) the largest value of gradient, T̂ 0 = x̂ 4 x̂ 3 x̂ 1 ŷ 0 , added another four top-ranked linearly independent entanglers T̂ 1–4 = ẑ 2 T̂ 0 , ẑ 5 T̂ 0 , ẑ 2 ẑ 5 T̂ 0 , and x̂ 2 x̂ 5 T̂ 0 , which couple qubits (4, 3, 1, 0) with the remaining qubits, and added three mutually commuting two-qubit entanglers with largest gradients that provide pairwise relaxation of qubit degrees of freedom within and outside the cluster: T̂ 5 = x̂ 0 ŷ 2 , T̂ 6 = ŷ 1 x̂ 4 , and T̂ 7 = x̂ 3 ŷ 5 .
These eight entanglers provide chemical accuracy only near the equilibrium geometry. Contrary to the traditional CCSD counterpart, the QCC potential energy curve stays above the exact one (see Figure 4 ), which is a result of the variational nature of QCC. Our QCC ansatz represented as a quantum circuit (35) uses 48 two-qubit CNOT gates. Similar to the case of LiH we could not exploit qubit symmetries and generated UCCSD Fermionic excitations for the original CAS(4,4) . The corresponding quantum circuit contains 1312 two-qubit C X gates. [Gate decomposition is done with ProjectQ .]

To address the problem of exponential growth of entanglers for screening in QCC, one can use qubit images of rank-limited UCC cluster operators. This will generate a shorter list of Pauli words than in the full lexicographical ordered list of entanglers. Such a hybrid approach combines Fock-space and Hilbert-space screening procedures and allows for even more resource-efficient schemes.

We have introduced and studied a new method for performing electronic structure calculations on a quantum computer. We called our method the qubit coupled cluster (QCC) to emphasize that it is rooted in the unitary coupled cluster (UCC) theory but, contrary to UCC, formulated without any reference to Fermionic algebra exclusively in terms of qubit operators.
From the mathematical point of view, QCC is a variational method where variational optimization of single-qubit rotations and multiqubit unitary transformation are done altogether. The single-qubit Hilbert space is parametrized in terms of spin coherent states which depend on Bloch angles. There are only two angles per qubit, and terms of the qubit Hamiltonian have exceptionally simple expressions for matrix elements in the chosen basis.
The essential feature of the QCC form is the multiqubit unitary transformations in terms of Pauli words—products of Pauli operators. Such transformations are the simplest possible in the qubit tensor algebra; they lead to a compact economical form of unitarily transformed operators such as the Hamiltonian itself ( eq 20 ). This simplicity allows for extremely frugal use of quantum resources such as two-qubit entanglement gates. Moreover, we derived the decomposition of a multiqubit unitary rotation to a product of two-qubit unitary rotations, eq 32 . This formula can make simulations of highly entangled systems possible on hardware that is limited by entanglement of only two qubits.
Formulations of the quantum chemistry in the qubit space have several complications. First, even though only isospectral Fermionic-to-qubit transformations are employed, and thus all symmetries of the Fermionic system are replicated in its qubit counterpart, this is not generally true for approximate methods. Indeed, in ref (28) , we found that breaking of physical symmetries, such as the number of electrons or spin, in qubit variational methods is more a rule than an exception. At the same time, this problem can be solved by using appropriate constraints. Second, by treating a molecular system directly in the qubit space, it is not straightforward to use typical electronic structure intuition, for example, information about whether this system is weakly correlated like a closed-shell molecule near equilibrium geometry, or strongly correlated like an open-shell radical with many quasi-degenerate orbitals. We address this shortcoming by devising the derivative test, eq 25 , which allows one to tailor the QCC ansatz to a given molecular system in an efficient manner.
We illustrate our approach by considering the dissociation of the H 2 and LiH molecules in the minimal basis and symmetric water dissociation in the Pople 6-31G basis set. (32) These systems represent increasingly more complex examples of quantum entanglement. In all cases we identified a short list (one to eight entries) of entanglers mainly due to implementation limitations. However, even such short expansions were shown to be efficient. For H 2 the exact solution requires only one entangler, for LiH chemical accuracy (≤1 kcal/mol) for the whole potential curve is achieved, and for H 2 O we calculated a physically correct potential energy curve with chemical accuracy near the potential minimum. We hope, therefore, that the QCC method will become the method of choice for quantum chemistry on a quantum computer in near future.

We define H̃ ( t ) = e – itP̂ /2 Ĥ e – itP̂ /2 ; then the QCC energy function eq 21 can be compactly written as (34) The minimization condition makes the Bloch angles functions of t . It is convenient to introduce | Ω min ⟩ to denote the coherent state evaluated at optimized Bloch angles, {φ i 0 } i =1 2 N q .
The first derivative of the similarity-transformed energy can be written as (35) Expanding the derivative of the mean-field state d| Ω min ⟩ /d t as (36) and accounting for the fact that all φ i are real, we can write (37) The sum of derivatives in eq 37 vanishes because the expression in square brackets is equal to 0 for any i due to the condition of φ i optimality. Thus, eq 25 follows from eq 35 as (38)
To derive an expression for the second derivative, consider the QCC energy as a function of entangler’s amplitudes and Bloch angles [cf. eq 18 ] (39) Expanding E e into a multivariate Taylor series at t = 0 and φ i = φ i 0 up to the second order gives (40) where Δ φ = φ – φ 0 , (41) (42) and the first partial derivatives ∂ E e /∂ φ at t = 0 are zero because we have chosen the origin of the Tailor expansion at the mean-field solution. In fact, Bloch angles are minimized in eq 34 for every value of the amplitude t , not only at t = 0, which leads to the following linear equations that determine the optimal set of Bloch angles for a given t (43) or (44) Equation 44 can be interpreted as a linearized form of a nonlinear equation that determines minimizing Bloch angles as functions of the amplitude in eq 21 .
Inserting eq 44 into eq 40 and collecting terms of the same power in t gives the second-order derivative of E ( t ) in terms of derivatives in eq 40 : (45) General expressions for the derivatives in the right-hand side of eq 45 follow (46) and (47) (48)
The derivatives of the coherent states, eq 16 , that appear in eqs 47 and 48 are then evaluated. Since the coherent states constitute a full basis in the (two-dimensional) Hilbert space of a single qubit, it is possible to express the corresponding derivatives in the form of operators acting on a given coherent state. In particular, if θ i is a polar angle of the i th qubit, and then direct evaluation of the corresponding derivative from eq 16 gives (49) This derivative can be also written as (50) where ŝ + ( i ) = ( x̂ i + iŷ i )/2, ŝ – ( i ) = ( x̂ i – iŷ i )/2, and x̂ i , ŷ i are spin raising, lowering, Pauli x̂ , and ŷ operators for the i th qubit, respectively. Analogously, the derivative of |Ω i ⟩ with respect to the azimuthal angle ϕ i can be evaluated as (51) Successive application of eqs 50 and 51 gives access to higher-order derivatives of the coherent states.
Determining Missing Angles
From eq 16 it is obvious that values of ϕ i angles corresponding to θ i = 0 or π will not affect qubit mean-field energy, and thus, the mean-field procedure does not define them. However, these angles will determine the values of the second derivatives due to differentiation in eq 50 . To determine these ϕ i angles, we re-optimize all angles for small values of τ (e.g., 10 –3 ) in the similarity-transformed Hamiltonian. This procedure can be combined with a derivative discontinuity test that we discuss next.
Derivative Discontinuities
Another caveat of working with the derivatives of similarity-transformed energies eq 34 is that, occasionally, first derivatives have discontinuities in the τ = 0 point. In this case, the second derivative is not defined and should not be used. Such situations can be detected by evaluating QMF solutions for the similarity-transformed Hamiltonian ( eq 20 ) with small amplitudes (e.g., τ = ±10 –3 ) and calculating the first derivatives in these points using eq 25 with the Ĥ [τ; P̂ ] Hamiltonian instead of Ĥ . If the first derivatives are significantly different, this is a numerical indication of the derivative discontinuity, and the second derivative is not evaluated.

    The calcn. time for the energy of atoms and mols. scales exponentially with system size on a classical computer but polynomially using quantum algorithms. We demonstrate that such algorithms can be applied to problems of chem. interest using modest nos. of quantum bits. Calcns. of the water and lithium hydride mol. ground-state energies have been carried out on a quantum computer simulator using a recursive phase-estn. algorithm. The recursive algorithm reduces the no. of quantum bits required for the readout register from about 20 to 4. Mappings of the mol. wave function to the quantum bits are described. An adiabatic method for the prepn. of a good approx. ground-state wave function is described and demonstrated for a stretched hydrogen mol. The no. of quantum bits required scales linearly with the no. of basis functions, and the no. of gates required grows polynomially with the no. of quantum bits.

    We define a model of quantum computation with local fermionic modes (LFMs)-sites which can be either empty or occupied by a fermion. With the std. correspondence between the Foch space of m LFMs and the Hilbert space of m qubits, simulation of one fermionic gate takes O(m) qubit gates and vice versa. We show that using different encodings, the simulation cost can be reduced to O(log m) and a const., resp. Nearest neighbors fermionic gates on a graph of bounded degree can be simulated at a const. cost. A universal set of fermionic gates is found. We also study computation with Majorana fermions which are basically halves of LFMs. Some connection to qubit quantum codes is made.

    The Bravyi-Kitaev transformation for quantum computation of electronic structure

    Quantum simulation is an important application of future quantum computers with applications in quantum chem., condensed matter, and beyond. Quantum simulation of fermionic systems presents a specific challenge. The Jordan-Wigner transformation allows for representation of a fermionic operator by O(n) qubit operations. Here, we develop an alternative method of simulating fermions with qubits, first proposed by Bravyi and Kitaev (2002) that reduces the simulation cost to O(log n) qubit operations for one fermionic operation. We apply this new Bravyi-Kitaev transformation to the task of simulating quantum chem. Hamiltonians, and give a detailed example for the simplest possible case of mol. hydrogen in a minimal basis. We show that the quantum circuit for simulating a single Trotter time step of the Bravyi-Kitaev derived Hamiltonian for H2 requires fewer gate applications than the equiv. circuit derived from the Jordan-Wigner transformation. Since the scaling of the Bravyi-Kitaev method is asymptotically better than the Jordan-Wigner method, this result for mol. hydrogen in a minimal basis demonstrates the superior efficiency of the Bravyi-Kitaev method for all quantum computations of electronic structure.

    Quantum chem. is an important area of application for quantum computation. In particular, quantum algorithms applied to the electronic structure problem promise exact, efficient methods for detn. of the electronic energy of atoms and mols. The Bravyi-Kitaev transformation is a method of mapping the occupation state of a fermionic system onto qubits. This transformation maps the Hamiltonian of n interacting fermions to an O(log(n))-local Hamiltonian of n qubits. This is an improvement in locality over the Jordan-Wigner transformation, which results in an O(n)-local qubit Hamiltonian. We present the Bravyi-Kitaev transformation in detail, introducing the sets of qubits which must be acted on to change occupancy and parity of states in the occupation no. basis. We give recursive definitions of these sets and of the transformation and inverse transformation matrixes, which relate the occupation no. basis and the Bravyi-Kitaev basis. We then compare the use of the Jordan-Wigner and Bravyi-Kitaev Hamiltonians for the quantum simulation of methane using the STO-6G basis.

Both first and second quantized descriptions are considered, and the relative computational complexities are detd. in each case. In order to accommodate fermions using a first quantized Hamiltonian, an efficient quantum algorithm for antisymmetrization is given. Finally, a simulation of the Hubbard model is discussed in detail.

    We describe a new polynomial time quantum algorithm that uses the quantum fast Fourier transform to find eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a local Hamiltonian, and that can be applied in cases (commonly found in ab initio physics and chem. problems) for which all known classical algorithms require exponential time. Applications of the algorithm to specific problems are considered, and we find that classically intractable and interesting problems from at. physics may be solved with between 50 and 100 quantum bits.

    Quantum computers promise to efficiently solve important problems that are intractable on a conventional computer. For quantum systems, where the phys. dimension grows exponentially, finding the eigenvalues of certain operators is one such intractable problem and remains a fundamental challenge. The quantum phase estn. algorithm efficiently finds the eigenvalue of a given eigenvector but requires fully coherent evolution. Here we present an alternative approach that greatly reduces the requirements for coherent evolution and combine this method with a new approach to state prepn. based on ansatze and classical optimization. We implement the algorithm by combining a highly reconfigurable photonic quantum processor with a conventional computer. We exptl. demonstrate the feasibility of this approach with an example from quantum chem.-calcg. the ground-state mol. energy for He-H+. The proposed approach drastically reduces the coherence time requirements, enhancing the potential of quantum resources available today and in the near future.

    The prepn. of quantum states using short quantum circuits is one of the most promising near-term applications of small quantum computers, esp. if the circuit is short enough and the fidelity of gates high enough that it can be executed without quantum error correction. Such quantum state prepn. can be used in variational approaches, optimizing parameters in the circuit to minimize the energy of the constructed quantum state for a given problem Hamiltonian. For this purpose we propose a simple-to-implement class of quantum states motivated by adiabatic state prepn. We test its accuracy and det. the required circuit depth for a Hubbard model on ladders with up to 12 sites (24 spin orbitals), and for small mols. We find that this ansatz converges faster than previously proposed schemes based on unitary coupled clusters. While the required no. of measurements is astronomically large for quantum chem. applications to mols., applying the variational approach to the Hubbard model (and related models) is found to be far less demanding and potentially practical on small quantum computers. We also discuss another application of quantum state prepn. using short quantum circuits, to prep. trial ground states of models faster than using adiabatic state prepn.

    The advantages and possibilities of a unitary coupled-cluster (CC) theory are examd. It is shown that using a unitary parameterization of the wave function guarantees agreement between a sum-over-states polarization propagator and response theory calcn. of properties of arbitrary order, as opposed to the case in conventional CC theory. Then, using Zassenhaus expansion for noncommuting exponential operators, explicit diagrams for an extensive and variational method based on unitary CC theory are derived. Possible extensions to the approxns. developed are discussed as well.

    A general coupled cluster method that allows arbitrary excitations from a single ref.-determinant is proposed and tested. The method is based on a generalization of the formalism of spin-strings and provides a unified method for the storage and manipulation of coupled cluster operators. An initial implementation of the method is discussed and used to study the convergence of the coupled cluster hierarchy for H2O and CH2 at equil. geometry, employing up to eightfold excitations. The energy and wave function contributions of the various excitation levels are examd. The dissocn. curve of HF is also studied. Using single and double excitations from a minimal active space, the coupled cluster dissocn. curve for HF shows a largest deviation from full CI curve of 1.3 mEh, which decreases by an order of magnitude up on the addn. of triple excitations out of the active space.

    We report the first electronic structure calcn. performed on a quantum computer without exponentially costly precompilation. We use a programmable array of superconducting qubits to compute the energy surface of mol. hydrogen using two distinct quantum algorithms. First, we exptl. execute the unitary coupled cluster method using the variational quantum eigensolver. Our efficient implementation predicts the correct dissocn. energy to within chem. accuracy of the numerically exact result. Second, we exptl. demonstrate the canonical quantum algorithm for chem., which consists of Trotterization and quantum phase estn. We compare the exptl. performance of these approaches to show clear evidence that the variational quantum eigensolver is robust to certain errors. This error tolerance inspires hope that variational quantum simulations of classically intractable mols. may be viable in the near future.

    Over the last century, a large no. of phys. and math. developments paired with rapidly advancing technol. have allowed the field of quantum chem. to advance dramatically. However, the lack of computationally efficient methods for the exact simulation of quantum systems on classical computers presents a limitation of current computational approaches. We report, in detail, how a set of pre-computed mol. integrals can be used to explicitly create a quantum circuit, i.e. a sequence of elementary quantum operations, that, when run on a quantum computer, obtains the energy of a mol. system with fixed nuclear geometry using the quantum phase estn. algorithm. We extend several known results related to this idea and discuss the adiabatic state prepn. procedure for prepg. the input states used in the algorithm. With current and near future quantum devices in mind, we provide a complete example using the hydrogen mol. of how a chem. Hamiltonian can be simulated using a quantum computer.

    Quantum computers can be used to address electronic-structure problems and problems in materials science and condensed matter physics that can be formulated as interacting fermionic problems, problems which stretch the limits of existing high-performance computers. Finding exact solns. to such problems numerically has a computational cost that scales exponentially with the size of the system, and Monte Carlo methods are unsuitable owing to the fermionic sign problem. These limitations of classical computational methods have made solving even few-atom electronic-structure problems interesting for implementation using medium-sized quantum computers. Yet exptl. implementations have so far been restricted to mols. involving only hydrogen and helium. Here we demonstrate the exptl. optimization of Hamiltonian problems with up to six qubits and more than one hundred Pauli terms, detg. the ground-state energy for mols. of increasing size, up to BeH2. We achieve this result by using a variational quantum eigenvalue solver (eigensolver) with efficiently prepd. trial states that are tailored specifically to the interactions that are available in our quantum processor, combined with a compact encoding of fermionic Hamiltonians and a robust stochastic optimization routine. We demonstrate the flexibility of our approach by applying it to a problem of quantum magnetism, an antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model in an external magnetic field. In all cases, we find agreement between our expts. and numerical simulations using a model of the device with noise. Our results help to elucidate the requirements for scaling the method to larger systems and for bridging the gap between key problems in high-performance computing and their implementation on quantum hardware.

    For the description of an assembly of 2-level atoms, at. coherent states can be defined which have properties analogous to those of the field-coherent states. The analogy is not fortuitous, but is related to the group contraction of exponential operators based on the angular momentum algebra to exponential operators based on the harmonic-oscillator algebra. The derivation of the properties of the at. coherent states is made easier by the use of a powerful disentangling theorem for exponential angular momentum operators. A complete labeling of the at. states is developed and many of their properties are studied. In particular the at. coherent states are the quantum analogs of classical dipoles, and they can be produced by classical fields.

The method is used to apply single- and multi-ref. CI and coupled-cluster theories, with RHF, UHF, and complete-active-space self-consistent-field (CASSCF) orbitals, to the sym. dissocn. of water. Results from unrestricted state-selective multi-ref. coupled-cluster theory are presented for the first time.

    Basis sets are some of the most important input data for computational models in the chem., materials, biol., and other science domains that utilize computational quantum mechanics methods. Providing a shared, Web-accessible environment where researchers can not only download basis sets in their required format but browse the data, contribute new basis sets, and ultimately curate and manage the data as a community will facilitate growth of this resource and encourage sharing both data and knowledge. We describe the Basis Set Exchange (BSE), a Web portal that provides advanced browsing and download capabilities, facilities for contributing basis set data, and an environment that incorporates tools to foster development and interaction of communities. The BSE leverages and enables continued development of the basis set library originally assembled at the Environmental Mol. Sciences Lab.

        The calcn. time for the energy of atoms and mols. scales exponentially with system size on a classical computer but polynomially using quantum algorithms. We demonstrate that such algorithms can be applied to problems of chem. interest using modest nos. of quantum bits. Calcns. of the water and lithium hydride mol. ground-state energies have been carried out on a quantum computer simulator using a recursive phase-estn. algorithm. The recursive algorithm reduces the no. of quantum bits required for the readout register from about 20 to 4. Mappings of the mol. wave function to the quantum bits are described. An adiabatic method for the prepn. of a good approx. ground-state wave function is described and demonstrated for a stretched hydrogen mol. The no. of quantum bits required scales linearly with the no. of basis functions, and the no. of gates required grows polynomially with the no. of quantum bits.

        We define a model of quantum computation with local fermionic modes (LFMs)-sites which can be either empty or occupied by a fermion. With the std. correspondence between the Foch space of m LFMs and the Hilbert space of m qubits, simulation of one fermionic gate takes O(m) qubit gates and vice versa. We show that using different encodings, the simulation cost can be reduced to O(log m) and a const., resp. Nearest neighbors fermionic gates on a graph of bounded degree can be simulated at a const. cost. A universal set of fermionic gates is found. We also study computation with Majorana fermions which are basically halves of LFMs. Some connection to qubit quantum codes is made.

        The Bravyi-Kitaev transformation for quantum computation of electronic structure
        Seeley, Jacob T.; Richard, Martin J.; Love, Peter J.

        Quantum simulation is an important application of future quantum computers with applications in quantum chem., condensed matter, and beyond. Quantum simulation of fermionic systems presents a specific challenge. The Jordan-Wigner transformation allows for representation of a fermionic operator by O(n) qubit operations. Here, we develop an alternative method of simulating fermions with qubits, first proposed by Bravyi and Kitaev (2002) that reduces the simulation cost to O(log n) qubit operations for one fermionic operation. We apply this new Bravyi-Kitaev transformation to the task of simulating quantum chem. Hamiltonians, and give a detailed example for the simplest possible case of mol. hydrogen in a minimal basis. We show that the quantum circuit for simulating a single Trotter time step of the Bravyi-Kitaev derived Hamiltonian for H2 requires fewer gate applications than the equiv. circuit derived from the Jordan-Wigner transformation. Since the scaling of the Bravyi-Kitaev method is asymptotically better than the Jordan-Wigner method, this result for mol. hydrogen in a minimal basis demonstrates the superior efficiency of the Bravyi-Kitaev method for all quantum computations of electronic structure.

        Quantum chem. is an important area of application for quantum computation. In particular, quantum algorithms applied to the electronic structure problem promise exact, efficient methods for detn. of the electronic energy of atoms and mols. The Bravyi-Kitaev transformation is a method of mapping the occupation state of a fermionic system onto qubits. This transformation maps the Hamiltonian of n interacting fermions to an O(log(n))-local Hamiltonian of n qubits. This is an improvement in locality over the Jordan-Wigner transformation, which results in an O(n)-local qubit Hamiltonian. We present the Bravyi-Kitaev transformation in detail, introducing the sets of qubits which must be acted on to change occupancy and parity of states in the occupation no. basis. We give recursive definitions of these sets and of the transformation and inverse transformation matrixes, which relate the occupation no. basis and the Bravyi-Kitaev basis. We then compare the use of the Jordan-Wigner and Bravyi-Kitaev Hamiltonians for the quantum simulation of methane using the STO-6G basis.

        We provide fast algorithms for simulating many-body Fermi systems on a universal quantum computer. Both first and second quantized descriptions are considered, and the relative computational complexities are detd. in each case. In order to accommodate fermions using a first quantized Hamiltonian, an efficient quantum algorithm for antisymmetrization is given. Finally, a simulation of the Hubbard model is discussed in detail.

        We describe a new polynomial time quantum algorithm that uses the quantum fast Fourier transform to find eigenvalues and eigenvectors of a local Hamiltonian, and that can be applied in cases (commonly found in ab initio physics and chem. problems) for which all known classical algorithms require exponential time. Applications of the algorithm to specific problems are considered, and we find that classically intractable and interesting problems from at. physics may be solved with between 50 and 100 quantum bits.

        Quantum computers promise to efficiently solve important problems that are intractable on a conventional computer. For quantum systems, where the phys. dimension grows exponentially, finding the eigenvalues of certain operators is one such intractable problem and remains a fundamental challenge. The quantum phase estn. algorithm efficiently finds the eigenvalue of a given eigenvector but requires fully coherent evolution. Here we present an alternative approach that greatly reduces the requirements for coherent evolution and combine this method with a new approach to state prepn. based on ansatze and classical optimization. We implement the algorithm by combining a highly reconfigurable photonic quantum processor with a conventional computer. We exptl. demonstrate the feasibility of this approach with an example from quantum chem.-calcg. the ground-state mol. energy for He-H+. The proposed approach drastically reduces the coherence time requirements, enhancing the potential of quantum resources available today and in the near future.

        The prepn. of quantum states using short quantum circuits is one of the most promising near-term applications of small quantum computers, esp. if the circuit is short enough and the fidelity of gates high enough that it can be executed without quantum error correction. Such quantum state prepn. can be used in variational approaches, optimizing parameters in the circuit to minimize the energy of the constructed quantum state for a given problem Hamiltonian. For this purpose we propose a simple-to-implement class of quantum states motivated by adiabatic state prepn. We test its accuracy and det. the required circuit depth for a Hubbard model on ladders with up to 12 sites (24 spin orbitals), and for small mols. We find that this ansatz converges faster than previously proposed schemes based on unitary coupled clusters. While the required no. of measurements is astronomically large for quantum chem. applications to mols., applying the variational approach to the Hubbard model (and related models) is found to be far less demanding and potentially practical on small quantum computers. We also discuss another application of quantum state prepn. using short quantum circuits, to prep. trial ground states of models faster than using adiabatic state prepn.

        The advantages and possibilities of a unitary coupled-cluster (CC) theory are examd. It is shown that using a unitary parameterization of the wave function guarantees agreement between a sum-over-states polarization propagator and response theory calcn. of properties of arbitrary order, as opposed to the case in conventional CC theory. Then, using Zassenhaus expansion for noncommuting exponential operators, explicit diagrams for an extensive and variational method based on unitary CC theory are derived. Possible extensions to the approxns. developed are discussed as well.

        A general coupled cluster method that allows arbitrary excitations from a single ref.-determinant is proposed and tested. The method is based on a generalization of the formalism of spin-strings and provides a unified method for the storage and manipulation of coupled cluster operators. An initial implementation of the method is discussed and used to study the convergence of the coupled cluster hierarchy for H2O and CH2 at equil. geometry, employing up to eightfold excitations. The energy and wave function contributions of the various excitation levels are examd. The dissocn. curve of HF is also studied. Using single and double excitations from a minimal active space, the coupled cluster dissocn. curve for HF shows a largest deviation from full CI curve of 1.3 mEh, which decreases by an order of magnitude up on the addn. of triple excitations out of the active space.

        We report the first electronic structure calcn. performed on a quantum computer without exponentially costly precompilation. We use a programmable array of superconducting qubits to compute the energy surface of mol. hydrogen using two distinct quantum algorithms. First, we exptl. execute the unitary coupled cluster method using the variational quantum eigensolver. Our efficient implementation predicts the correct dissocn. energy to within chem. accuracy of the numerically exact result. Second, we exptl. demonstrate the canonical quantum algorithm for chem., which consists of Trotterization and quantum phase estn. We compare the exptl. performance of these approaches to show clear evidence that the variational quantum eigensolver is robust to certain errors. This error tolerance inspires hope that variational quantum simulations of classically intractable mols. may be viable in the near future.

        Simulation of electronic structure Hamiltonians using quantum computers

        Over the last century, a large no. of phys. and math. developments paired with rapidly advancing technol. have allowed the field of quantum chem. to advance dramatically. However, the lack of computationally efficient methods for the exact simulation of quantum systems on classical computers presents a limitation of current computational approaches. We report, in detail, how a set of pre-computed mol. integrals can be used to explicitly create a quantum circuit, i.e. a sequence of elementary quantum operations, that, when run on a quantum computer, obtains the energy of a mol. system with fixed nuclear geometry using the quantum phase estn. algorithm. We extend several known results related to this idea and discuss the adiabatic state prepn. procedure for prepg. the input states used in the algorithm. With current and near future quantum devices in mind, we provide a complete example using the hydrogen mol. of how a chem. Hamiltonian can be simulated using a quantum computer.

        Hardware-efficient variational quantum eigensolver for small molecules and quantum magnets

        Quantum computers can be used to address electronic-structure problems and problems in materials science and condensed matter physics that can be formulated as interacting fermionic problems, problems which stretch the limits of existing high-performance computers. Finding exact solns. to such problems numerically has a computational cost that scales exponentially with the size of the system, and Monte Carlo methods are unsuitable owing to the fermionic sign problem. These limitations of classical computational methods have made solving even few-atom electronic-structure problems interesting for implementation using medium-sized quantum computers. Yet exptl. implementations have so far been restricted to mols. involving only hydrogen and helium. Here we demonstrate the exptl. optimization of Hamiltonian problems with up to six qubits and more than one hundred Pauli terms, detg. the ground-state energy for mols. of increasing size, up to BeH2. We achieve this result by using a variational quantum eigenvalue solver (eigensolver) with efficiently prepd. trial states that are tailored specifically to the interactions that are available in our quantum processor, combined with a compact encoding of fermionic Hamiltonians and a robust stochastic optimization routine. We demonstrate the flexibility of our approach by applying it to a problem of quantum magnetism, an antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model in an external magnetic field. In all cases, we find agreement between our expts. and numerical simulations using a model of the device with noise. Our results help to elucidate the requirements for scaling the method to larger systems and for bridging the gap between key problems in high-performance computing and their implementation on quantum hardware.

        Atomic coherent states in quantum optics
        Arecchi, F. T.; Courtens, Eric; Gilmore, Robert; Thomas, Harry

        For the description of an assembly of 2-level atoms, at. coherent states can be defined which have properties analogous to those of the field-coherent states. The analogy is not fortuitous, but is related to the group contraction of exponential operators based on the angular momentum algebra to exponential operators based on the harmonic-oscillator algebra. The derivation of the properties of the at. coherent states is made easier by the use of a powerful disentangling theorem for exponential angular momentum operators. A complete labeling of the at. states is developed and many of their properties are studied. In particular the at. coherent states are the quantum analogs of classical dipoles, and they can be produced by classical fields.

        We present a determinant-based method used to formulate many-body wave functions and energy expectation values of any quantum chem. model which can be written in terms of second-quantized operators. The method is used to apply single- and multi-ref. CI and coupled-cluster theories, with RHF, UHF, and complete-active-space self-consistent-field (CASSCF) orbitals, to the sym. dissocn. of water. Results from unrestricted state-selective multi-ref. coupled-cluster theory are presented for the first time.

        Basis sets are some of the most important input data for computational models in the chem., materials, biol., and other science domains that utilize computational quantum mechanics methods. Providing a shared, Web-accessible environment where researchers can not only download basis sets in their required format but browse the data, contribute new basis sets, and ultimately curate and manage the data as a community will facilitate growth of this resource and encourage sharing both data and knowledge. We describe the Basis Set Exchange (BSE), a Web portal that provides advanced browsing and download capabilities, facilities for contributing basis set data, and an environment that incorporates tools to foster development and interaction of communities. The BSE leverages and enables continued development of the basis set library originally assembled at the Environmental Mol. Sciences Lab.
