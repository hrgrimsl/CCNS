	abstract = {We demonstrate long-lived coherence in internal hyperfine states of a single {\textbackslash}Ca\{43\} trapped-ion qubit \$[T\_2=1.2(2){\textbackslash}s]\$, and in external motional states of a single {\textbackslash}Ca\{40\} trapped-ion qubit \$[T\_2'=0.18(4){\textbackslash}s]\$, in the same apparatus. The motional decoherence rate is consistent with the heating rate, which was measured to be 3(1) quanta/sec. Long coherence times in the external motional states are essential for performing high-fidelity quantum logic gates between trapped-ion qubits. The internal-state \$T\_2\$ time that we observe in {\textbackslash}Ca\{43\}, which has not previously been used as a trapped-ion qubit, is about one thousand times longer than that of physical qubits based on {\textbackslash}Ca\{40\} ions. Using a single spin-echo pulse to ``re-phase'' the internal state, we can detect no decoherence after 1{\textbackslash}s, implying an effective coherence time \$T\_2{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}mbox\{{\textbackslash}tiny SE\}\} {\textbackslash}gtish 45{\textbackslash}s\$. This compares with timescales in this trap for single-qubit operations of {\textbackslash}ish 1{\textbackslash}us, and for two-qubit operations of {\textbackslash}ish 10{\textbackslash}us.},
